## ⚠️ What's Different?

**IMPORTANT**: Touch Mode requires **additional wiring** compared to standard Prospector Scanner.

### Key Differences from Non-Touch Mode

| Feature | Non-Touch Mode | Touch Mode |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Wiring** | 6 display pins + VCC/GND | **+4 touch pins required** |
| **Build Configuration** | `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_TOUCH_ENABLED=n` | `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_TOUCH_ENABLED=y` |
| Display Settings | Kconfig only | Interactive screen |
| Gestures | Not supported | 4-direction swipes |
| Firmware Size | ~900KB | ~920KB (+20KB) |
| On-Device Adjustment | Not supported | Yes (max layers, etc.) |

### ⚠️ Additional Wiring Required

Touch Mode adds **4 extra connections** to the standard Prospector Scanner wiring:

```
Standard Scanner: 6 pins (LCD_DIN, LCD_CLK, LCD_CS, LCD_DC, LCD_RST, LCD_BL) + Power
Touch Mode: +4 pins (TP_SDA, TP_SCL, TP_INT, TP_RST)
Total: 10 signal pins + VCC/GND
```

**You cannot use touch firmware without these 4 additional connections.**

### What Touch Mode Enables

- ✅ **Swipe Gestures**: Navigate between screens with 4-direction swipes
- ✅ **Display Settings**: Adjust brightness, max layers, slide mode
- ✅ **Keyboard List**: View detected keyboards with channel filter
- ✅ **Quick Actions**: Bootloader/Reset + firmware version display
- ✅ **Prospector Display**: Cycle through Field, Operator, Radii layouts

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Verify Hardware

**How to Identify Touch Display**:
- Product page mentions "CST816S" or "touch sensor"
- Has **extra 4-pin connector** for touch (TP_RST, TP_INT, TP_SDA, TP_SCL)
- Product name includes "Touch" - e.g., "1.69inch Touch LCD"
- [Waveshare Official Link](https://www.waveshare.com/1.69inch-touch-lcd.htm)

### Step 2: Add Touch Wiring (4 Additional Pins)

**⚠️ These 4 connections are REQUIRED in addition to standard scanner wiring:**

| Touch Pin | XIAO BLE Pin | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| TP_SDA | D4 (P0.04) | I2C Data |
| TP_SCL | D5 (P0.05) | I2C Clock |
| TP_INT | D0 (P0.02) | Interrupt |
| TP_RST | D1 (P0.28) | Reset |

**Note**: If you already have standard Prospector Scanner wired (6 display pins), just add these 4 touch pins. See [README - Hardware & Wiring](../README.md#hardware--wiring) for full pinout.

### Step 3: Build Touch Firmware

#### Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

The default workflow builds both touch and non-touch firmware automatically.

1. **Fork repository**: Go to [zmk-config-prospector](https://github.com/t-ogura/zmk-config-prospector) → Click **"Fork"**
2. **Enable Actions**: Go to "Actions" tab → Click "I understand my workflows, enable them"
3. **Trigger build**: Actions tab → "Build" workflow → "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
4. **Download**: After ~5-10 minutes, download `prospector_scanner_touch` artifact
5. **Extract**: Get the `.uf2` file from the zip

**To customize settings** (optional): Edit `config/prospector_scanner.conf` before triggering build. See [README - Configuration Guide](../README.md#configuration-guide) for options.

### Step 4: Flash Firmware

1. Connect XIAO BLE to computer via USB
2. **Enter bootloader mode**:
   - Press **RESET button twice quickly** (within 0.5 seconds)
   - RGB LED should pulse green/blue
   - `XIAO-SENSE` drive appears
3. **Copy firmware**:
   - Drag `.uf2` file to `XIAO-SENSE` drive
   - Drive will disconnect automatically
   - Scanner boots with touch firmware

#### Option B: Local Build

**Prerequisites**

```bash
# Install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install west

# Initialize workspace
west init -l config
west update
```

**Enable Touch Mode**

Edit `config/prospector_scanner.conf`:

```conf
# Enable touch panel support
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_TOUCH_ENABLED=y

# Increase max layers for touch mode
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_MAX_LAYERS=10
```

**Build Command**

```bash
# From zmk-config-prospector directory
west build -b xiao_ble/nrf52840 -s zmk/app -- \
  -DSHIELD=prospector_scanner \
  -DZMK_CONFIG="$(pwd)/config"

# Output: build/zephyr/zmk.uf2
```

**Flash**: Same as Option A - copy `build/zephyr/zmk.uf2` to XIAO-SENSE drive.

### Step 5: Test Touch

1. Scanner should boot and show main screen
2. Try **DOWN swipe** - Display Settings should appear
3. Try **UP swipe** - Return to main screen
4. Try **UP swipe** - Keyboard List should appear
5. Try **DOWN swipe** - Return to main screen
6. Try **RIGHT swipe** - Quick Actions should appear
7. Try **LEFT swipe** - Return to main screen
8. Success! Touch mode is working

**If touch doesn't work**: See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

**For other configuration options** (brightness, timeout, battery, etc.): See [README - Configuration Guide](../README.md#configuration-guide).

## Screen Guide

### Main Screen (Default)

The main screen is **identical to non-touch mode**. See [README - Display Features](../README.md#-display-features) for UI element descriptions.

#### Gestures from Main Screen

- **DOWN Swipe**: Open Display Settings
- **UP Swipe**: Open Keyboard List
- **RIGHT Swipe**: Open Quick Actions
- **LEFT Swipe**: Open Prospector Display (Field / Operator / Radii layouts)

---

### Display Settings Screen

Interactive configuration screen - accessed via **DOWN swipe** from main screen.

#### Available Settings

Settings appear in this order from top to bottom:

##### 1. Brightness

**Slider**: Adjust display brightness (0-100%)

**Auto Toggle**: When enabled, brightness automatically adjusts based on ambient light sensor (requires APDS9960 hardware).

##### 2. Scanner Battery

**Toggle**: Show/hide scanner's own battery indicator on main screen.

**Note**: Only meaningful if LiPo battery is connected to XIAO BLE.

##### 3. Max Layers

**Slider**: Controls how many layer indicators are shown on main screen.

**Range**: 4 - 10 layers (limited by `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_MAX_LAYERS`)

**Slide Toggle**: Switch between two layer display modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **List Mode** (Slide OFF) | Shows all layer numbers. Active layer is highlighted. |
| **Slide Mode** (Slide ON) | Dial-style animated display. Active layer slides to center position. |

**Slide Mode Details**:
- Layer change animates based on direction (increase = slide from right, decrease = slide from left)
- When layer exceeds MAX_LAYERS, displays a single large number instead of the layer list
- Smooth transition animation between modes

#### Persistence Behavior

✅ **NVS Persistence** (v2.2.0): Settings **persist** across power cycles.

- Adjustments apply immediately and are saved to NVS flash
- Settings survive reboot and power loss
- Uses dirty flag + screen transition flush to prevent excessive writes
- To reset to defaults: use System Reset in Quick Actions screen

#### Gestures from Display Settings

- **UP Swipe**: Return to main screen

---

### Keyboard List Screen

Accessed via **UP swipe** from main screen. Shows all detected keyboards.

#### Features

- **Keyboard Cards**: Each detected keyboard shown as a card with name, battery, layer info
- **Channel Filter**: Filter which keyboards to display

#### Channel Filter Operations

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Swipe LEFT** | Decrease channel (e.g., 2 → 1) |
| **Swipe RIGHT** | Increase channel (e.g., 1 → 2) |
| **Tap "Ch" label** | Open channel selection popup (0-9) |

**Channel Values**:
- **0**: Show all keyboards (no filter)
- **1-9**: Only show keyboards broadcasting on that channel

**Use case**: In multi-keyboard environments, filter to show only your keyboards.

**Keyboard side**: Set `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_CHANNEL=N` in your keyboard's config (see [README](../README.md#channel-feature-v112)).

#### Gestures from Keyboard List

## Gesture Reference

### Swipe Detection

- **Minimum Distance**: ~30 pixels (~20% of screen width)
- **Timeout**: Must complete within 500ms
- **Directions**: 4-way (Up/Down/Left/Right)

### Gesture Map (v2.2)

| Gesture | Main Screen | Display Settings | Keyboard List | Quick Actions | Prospector Display |
|---------|-------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **DOWN** | Display Settings | - | Main Screen | - | Next Layout |
| **UP** | Keyboard List | Main Screen | - | - | Previous Layout |
| **LEFT** | Prospector Display | - | Channel -1 | Main Screen | - |
| **RIGHT** | Quick Actions | - | Channel +1 | - | Main Screen |

### Gesture Feedback

- **Visual**: Screen transitions with LVGL animation
- **No Haptic**: Display has no vibration motor
- **No Sound**: Silent operation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Touch Not Working

#### Symptom: No response to touch input

**Check List**:

1. **Verify Touch Hardware**:
   ```bash
   # Check I2C device detection (requires USB logging enabled)
   # Should show device at address 0x15
   ```

2. **Check Wiring**:
   - TP_SDA → D4 (P0.04)
   - TP_SCL → D5 (P0.05)
   - TP_INT → D0 (P0.02)
   - TP_RST → D1 (P0.28)

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   ```conf
   # Must be enabled
   CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_TOUCH_ENABLED=y
   CONFIG_INPUT_CST816S=y
   ```

4. **Check Firmware Build**:
   - Did you enable touch in config? (`CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_TOUCH_ENABLED=y`)
   - GitHub Actions: Did you edit `prospector_scanner.conf` to enable touch?

5. **I2C Bus Conflict**:
   - If APDS9960 also connected, verify both devices can coexist
   - Try disconnecting sensor temporarily to isolate issue

#### Symptom: Touch works but gestures don't register

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Swipe Too Slow**: Must complete within 500ms
2. **Swipe Too Short**: Minimum ~30 pixels distance required
3. **Screen Busy**: Wait for animations to complete before next gesture

### Display Settings Issues

#### Symptom: Cannot adjust slider beyond certain value

**Cause**: Kconfig `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_MAX_LAYERS` limits maximum.

**Solution**: Edit `prospector_scanner.conf`:
```conf
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_MAX_LAYERS=10  # Increase to desired maximum
```

Rebuild and reflash firmware.

#### Symptom: Settings reset after reboot

**v2.2.0+**: Settings should persist via NVS. If they don't:
1. Ensure you're running v2.2.0 or later firmware
2. Try System Reset in Quick Actions, then reconfigure

**v2.1.0 and earlier**: Settings do not persist (expected). Set defaults in Kconfig and rebuild.

### Build Errors

#### Error: `'lv_font_montserrat_XX' undeclared`

**Cause**: LVGL font not enabled in config.

**Solution**: Use the default `prospector_scanner.conf` which includes all required fonts. If using a custom config, copy the font settings from the default file.

#### Error: `undefined reference to touch_handler_register_lvgl_indev`

**Cause**: Touch code compiled but not properly initialized.

**Solution**: Verify widget creation order in code (developers only - this should not occur in release builds).

### Performance Issues

#### Symptom: Screen freezes during swipes

**Rare Issue**: Should be resolved in v2.2.0 with mutex + work handler architecture.

**If it occurs**:
1. Check firmware version - update to latest v2.2.0
2. Disable debug widget if enabled: `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_DEBUG_WIDGET=n`

**Report**: If freezing persists, please open GitHub issue with:
- Firmware version
- Number of keyboards being scanned
- Gesture that triggers freeze
- USB log output (if available)

#### Symptom: Slow response to gestures

**Normal Behavior**: Slight delay (100-200ms) is expected for:
- LVGL mutex acquisition
- Screen transition animations

**Abnormal Delay** (>500ms):
- Check CPU load - multiple keyboards + sensor + touch may be intensive
- Disable ambient light sensor temporarily: `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_USE_AMBIENT_LIGHT_SENSOR=n`
- Reduce update frequency: `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_SCANNER_TIMEOUT_MS` to higher value

## Advanced Topics

### Shared I2C Bus

Touch panel (0x15) and APDS9960 (0x39) share I2C bus on D4/D5:

```
I2C Bus (D4/D5)
├── CST816S Touch (0x15)
│   └── Interrupt-driven
└── APDS9960 Sensor (0x39)
    └── Polling mode (no interrupt)
```

**Compatibility**: Both devices tested working simultaneously - no conflicts observed.

### Memory Usage

Touch mode adds ~20KB to firmware size:

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| CST816S Driver | ~8KB |
| Touch Handler | ~3KB |
| Swipe Detection | ~2KB |
| Display Settings Screen | ~7KB |
| **Total Touch Overhead** | **~20KB** |

**Memory Safety**: XIAO BLE has 1MB flash - plenty of room for touch features.

### Power Consumption

Touch panel impact on battery life:

- **Touch Idle**: ~1mA (interrupt mode - waiting for touch)
- **Touch Active**: ~5mA (during gesture detection)
- **Negligible Impact**: Touch adds <2% to total power draw

**Battery Life Estimate** (with 500mAh LiPo):
- Display active: ~10 hours
- With timeout dimming: ~20+ hours
- Similar to non-touch mode

## FAQ

### Can I use touch firmware on non-touch display?

**No** - touch firmware requires CST816S hardware. It will build but touch features won't work and I2C errors may occur.

**Solution**: Use non-touch firmware (`prospector_scanner.conf`) for non-touch displays.

### Can I disable touch temporarily?

**Yes** - set in Kconfig:
```conf
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_TOUCH_ENABLED=n
```

Rebuild firmware. All touch code excluded at compile time.

### Will settings persist across reboots?

**Yes** (v2.2.0+) - settings are saved to NVS flash and persist across reboots and power cycles.

To reset settings to defaults, use System Reset in the Quick Actions screen.
